Here are some key features that contribute to its popularity:\n","\n","1.Readability and Simplicity: Python’s syntax is designed to be easy to read and write. The use of indentation to define code blocks rather than braces or keywords makes the code look clean and straightforward.\n","\n","2.High-Level Language: Python abstracts many complex details of the computer's operation, allowing developers to focus more on solving problems rather than managing low-level details.\n","\n","3.Versatile and General-Purpose: Python can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and scientific computing.\n","\n","4.Large Standard Library: Python comes with a vast standard library that includes modules and packages for handling various tasks, such as file I/O, system calls, and even internet protocols.\n","\n","5.Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, which means that code is executed line-by-line. This can simplify debugging and make development faster.\n","\n","6.Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is available on many operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it easy to run Python code across different environments.\n","\n","7.Extensive Ecosystem: Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Django, which extend its capabilities and help developers work efficiently.\n","\n","8.Community Support: Python has a large and active community. This means extensive documentation, numerous tutorials, forums, and a wide range of third-party modules and tools are available.\n","\n","9.Dynamic Typing: Python uses dynamic typing, which means you don’t need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. This can speed up development and reduce the amount of code you need to write.\n","\n","10.Object-Oriented and Functional Programming: Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming, providing flexibility in how code is structured and executed.\n","\n","These features combine to make Python an attractive choice for both beginners and experienced programmers across various domains."],"metadata":{"id":"jJJWm2M1KHTM"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"CtUjBZ-uKbUR"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Que:-2 Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.**"],"metadata":{"id":"bOkQFZyHNWxh"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"fX1R-6prNyrb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Ans:- In Python, predefined keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in the language.

The two main types of loops are `for` loops and `while` loops. Each type is suited to different scenarios.\n","\n","### 1. **`for` Loop**\n","\n","The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a list, tuple, string, or range. It is ideal when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat an action.\n","\n","**Use Cases:**\n","- Iterating through items in a list or other iterable.\n","- Repeating a task a specific number of times.\n","\n","**Examples:**\n","\n","- **Iterating Through a List:**\n","\n","  ```python\n","  # Example of for loop iterating through a list\n","  fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n","\n","  for fruit in fruits:\n","      print(fruit)\n","  ```\n","\n","  Output:\n","  ```\n","  apple\n","  banana\n","  cherry\n","  ```\n","\n","- **Using `range()` to Repeat an Action:**\n","\n","  ```python\n","  # Example of for loop using range\n","  for i in range(5):\n","      print(f\"Number {i}\")\n","  ```\n","\n","  Output:\n","  ```\n","  Number 0\n","  Number 1\n","  Number 2\n","  Number 3\n","  Number 4\n","  ```\n","\n","### 2. **`while` Loop**\n","\n","The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as its condition remains `True`. It is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on some condition.\n","\n","**Use Cases:**\n","- Repeating a task until a specific condition is met.\n","- Implementing a loop where the termination condition is determined at runtime.\n","\n","**Examples:**\n","\n","- **Basic While Loop:**\n","\n","  ```python\n","  # Example of while loop\n","  count = 0\n","\n","  while count < 5:\n","      print(f\"Count is {count}\")\n","      count += 1\n","  ```\n","\n","  Output:\n","  ```\n","  Count is 0\n","  Count is 1\n","  Count is 2\n","  Count is 3\n","  Count is 4\n","  ```\n","\n","- **Using a While Loop for User Input:**\n","\n","  ```python\n","  # Example of while loop with user input\n","  user_input = ''\n","\n","  while user_input.lower() != 'quit':\n","      user_input = input(\"Enter 'quit' to stop: \")\n","      print(f\"You entered: {user_input}\")\n","  ```\n","\n","  This loop continues until the user types \"quit\".\n","\n","### 3. **Loop Control Statements**\n","\n","Python provides several statements to control the behavior of loops:\n","\n","- **`break`**: Exits the loop prematurely.\n","  \n","  **Example:**\n","\n","  ```python\n","  # Example of break statement\n","  for i in range(10):\n","      if i == 5:\n","          break\n","      print(i)\n","  ```\n","\n","  Output:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  2\n","  3\n","  4\n","  ```\n","\n","- **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.\n","  \n","  **Example:**\n","\n","  ```python\n","  # Example of continue statement\n","  for i in range(10):\n","      if i % 2 == 0:\n","          continue\n","      print(i)\n","  ```\n","\n","  Output:\n","  ```\n","  1\n","  3\n","  5\n","  7\n","  9\n","  ```\n","\n","- **`else` with Loops**: The `else` block can be used with both `for` and `while` loops. It executes if the loop completes normally (i.e., it did not terminate via a `break` statement).\n","\n","  **Example:**\n","\n","  ```python\n","  # Example of else with a for loop\n","  for i in range(5):\n","      print(i)\n","  else:\n","      print(\"Loop completed without break.\")\n","  ```\n","\n","  Output:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  2\n","  3\n","  4\n","  Loop completed without break.\n","  ```\n","\n","### Summary\n","\n","- **`for` Loop**: Best for iterating over sequences and known ranges.\n","- **`while` Loop**: Suitable for situations where the number of iterations is not known ahead of time and depends on a condition.\n","- **Control Statements**: `break`, `continue`, and `else` can modify or handle loop execution behavior.\n","\n","These loops and control statements provide powerful tools for managing repetitive tasks and conditions in Python programming."],"metadata":{"id":"7NdS1hXzUZ6S"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"-A3RI1BZUkNs"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### ***Thank You***"],"metadata":{"id":"sHkKNTL6WGQM"}}]}
